# notes on unguided attempt

based on two sum options, I guess we could have somewhat a hashtable with possible sums of each element and a second hashtable as in single pass solution... I understand it would be an exponential increase in space complexity.

The naive aproach would be a three pointer method with O(n^3) in space complexity

what I did in my unguided solution was a two pointer where I find the third value with binary search. In my understanding it would be O(n^(2 \* log n)). However, I was kinda desperate and added like two sorts and parsing array into strings... Very clumsy.

I'm eager to watch Aaron's answer.
